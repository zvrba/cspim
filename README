PROJECT STRUCTURE
==

  bmips/        - precompiled programs for MIPS I; directly runnable by CSPIM
  hostapps/     - host utilities
  mipsapps/     - source fof programs runnable by CSPIM; precompiled in bmips/
  vm/           - core simulator: MIPS instruction set and ELF loader

HOW TO BUILD
==

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Working native compiler (e.g. gcc)
- Working cross-compiler which can generate little-endian MIPS I executables
- CMake (http://www.cmake.org)

This package has been developed and tested with both Sun's cc, gcc and Visual
Studio 2008 (project files for native tools are in the vc directory).  The
cross-compiler used was gcc configured for the mipsel-elf target;
gcc -v reports:

Target: mipsel-elf
Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/home/zvrba/COMPILE --disable-nls --target=mipsel-elf --disable-bootstrap --disable-libssp
Thread model: single
gcc version 4.2.3

1. To build the native tools (interpreter) on UNIX:
   ccmake . && make
2. To verify that the interpreter works correctly, follow the instructions in
   torture/README file.
3. To try out simple interactive demos, follow the instructions in
   demos/README file.


Self-simulation
---------------
Compile both HOSTED and non-HOSTED build.  This must be done in two separate
build directories.  Then, an extra executable is built, mipsapps/run-lvl1,
which should be run with hostapps/load-lvl1 (from the HOSTED build).  run-lvl1
can currently only run cputorture, since level2 simulation does not yet
forward system calls to level1 simulation.
